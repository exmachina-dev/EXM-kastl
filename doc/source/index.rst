Welcome to Ertza's documentation
================================

Ertza is a python program providing a simple, yet powerful, gateway between motor drive and protocols such as OSC or DMX.

It's designed to work on a BeagleBone Black with an ArmazCape on top.
For ArmazCape schematics and PCB design, please refer to `eisla-electronics repository`_

Ertza is usually embedded into Elias distro which is build using `Yocto Project`_.
Elias main layer can be found at `meta-exm-core repository`_

Ertza features:

* Communication with motor drive (via an extensible driver nodule interface)
  Currently only ModBus TCP is supported. A debug fake driver is also provided.
* Key events based on interrupts to expose basic actions or limit switches
* Remote control via multiple protocols
  Currently OSC and a serial protocol are implemented
* Cascading configuration scheme
* Configuration managed through profiles that allow quick reconfiguration
* Temperature watcher
* Fan regulator
* Configurable LED system
